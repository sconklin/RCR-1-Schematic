# Schematics for the Nucleonics Corp of America Model RCR-1 General Scaler-Ratemeter

There are probably errors in this.

I don't know how many of these there are surviving, but based on what I can find on the internet I think it's very few. If you have one, drop me a note.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2IJisdT82M&ab_channel=GeigerCounterVirtualMuseum) of one similar to mine (not my video).

Most of the circuit is pretty standard for the vacuum tube era, but there are two parts that are less common and worth a closer look.

## Interesting features

### Voltage multiplier

The high voltage supply functions similarly to the familiar modern switching boost regulator, although in this instrument, it's unregulated, as there is no feedback loop for regulation.

The 6V6 beam-power tetrode is driven by a neon bulb relaxation oscillator which uses the [Pearsonâ€“Anson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%E2%80%93Anson_effect) effect. The high voltage is rectified by the 5517 tube.

The output voltage is adjustable for different Geiger-Muller tubes. The output voltage drifts downward over several hours as the instrument warms up. This may be due to the high temperature coefficient of the carbon composition resistors used, but I haven't investigated.

### Decatron tubes and drivers

The instrument uses GC10B counter Decatron tubes for the ones and tens indicators, and an electromechanical solenoid-actuated counter for hundreds.

The GC10B [Decatrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekatron) require a pahsed application of voltage to two "guide electrodes" to advance the indicator to the next position. The signals are generated by a 12BH7 tube with one triode half acting as an amplifier, and the other acting as an inverter. The "carry" cathodes are used to drive the tens indicator, and to drive the solenoid driver for the hundreds counter.

## Notes

The instrument is essentially analog, with pulse amplification throughout and multiple signal paths. Because of this, it's possible to have what might seem like unexpected behavior. For example - with a [Geiger-Muller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93M%C3%BCller_tube) from a [CD V-700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_V-700) counter, everything works as expected with a tube voltage between 900 and 920 Volts. However, if the tube voltage is about 980 volts, you will still get audio clicks indicating pulses, but the Decatron indicator will only advance intermittently.
